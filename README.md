# ESAA-Sectorfile
Sweden FIR plugin and settings files for the GNG package used by controllers on VATSIM.

This repository contains non-automatically generated files from our sector file provider AeroNav GNG, including:
- Plugins
- Settings
- Manuals

[The Swedish vATIS profile](https://github.com/Vatsim-Scandinavia/ESAA-vATIS), [VatIRIS](https://github.com/minsulander/vatiris/) and [VatPLS](https://github.com/minsulander/vatpls/) have their own repos and are generally not managed here.

Bugs in the plugins themselves (TopSky/GRP or CDM) are handled externally on the [VATSIM Scandinavia forums](https://forum.vatsim-scandinavia.org/t/plugins), or [CDM Repo](https://github.com/rpuig2001/CDM)
